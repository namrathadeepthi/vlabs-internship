* Introduction
** What is a Web Application?
A web application runs continously on a web server and allows clients
to interact from their browser on the client side.The web app
interacts with a database.

The various phases in developing a web application are listed below.


* Requirements Gathering
  This is the first and important phase of the software development
  life cycle. The requirements are identified by listening to the
  client and further questions can be raised to clarify the
  requirements.
  Example: The requirements for a email-directory:
           The roles are identified as admin and a user.
           Each user has an email.
           No two users share the same email.
           Admin can create or delete users other than himself.
           Usr can view and update his details.           
           Futher requirements can be clarified -- eg: There can be
           more than one admin. A user can log using more than one session.
* Design of data model
  Data model is an abstract model, a collection of sets and relations of data that is
  formulated according to the requirements.A set is a collection of
  things and a relation is a mapping from one set to another.A
  relation from set A to B can be represented as r: A > B and its
  inverse: B>A  { (b,a) | bEB, aEA AND r(a,b) }
  ( A system consists of states and evolves over time)A system can be
  modelled as entities and relationships.Every relation can
  be represented as a table.For eg for the email-directory web app
  mentioned above:
     email:      User > Email! (Every user has exactly one email)
     name:       User > Name!  (Each user has exactly one name)
     role:       User > Role!  (Each user has exactly one role)
     user:       Session > User!(Each session belongs to one user)
  A data model consists of type-structure(entities and relationships)
  and state structure.
  
* Coding
  The actual implementation is done here using a programming language.
* Deployment
  -
* Testing
  Unit test cases are developed and the application is tested to
  ensure that it is free of bugs.
* Integration
* List of Technologies
  - [[https://www.python.org][Python]] :: Python will be the main language of implementation in this project.  The version needed is 2.7 (not 3.x).
  - [[https://github.com][git]]    :: Distributed version control system.
  - [[http://flask.pocoo.org/][Flask]] :: Flask is a framework for web development.  You will need to use version 0.10.1.
